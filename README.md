# Thermal-Visual-Inertial-Odometry-Thesis-Project
This directory includes the code that was developed for my masters thesis. 

A significant development that is not included here is the Lepton driver. The Lepton driver is a much better developed package that I am keeping separate from this code. The Lepton driver can be found here: https://github.com/lincolnkinley/lepton_driver_usb
